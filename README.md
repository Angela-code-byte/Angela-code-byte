### Hey! I’m Angela
I'm diving deep into Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI while still keeping my artistic roots alive. When I’m not wrangling datasets, I’m:

💀 Lurking as Viper in Valorant (lineups ready, enemies not)<br/>
🎨 Creating digital art (Trained fine artist, but pixels & Procreate stole my heart)<br/>
👩‍💻 Building AI-powered projects (because code is just another form of creativity)<br/>
👩‍💻 Currently Learning about Data Analytics, Statistics and [dataviz](https://pudding.cool/2024/03/teenagers/)

Always up for a 1v1, whether it’s in data science, design, or the clutch round. Let’s connect & create cool stuff!
